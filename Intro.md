# Introduction #

This page is only a brief intro about the project:
  * all code was written to be used by 3rd party developers, so more comments and explanations are present directly in the code itself
  * more tutorials and examples about specific aspects in the development are present on the official website http://www.itwizard.ro under the "android" categories
  * all code is released under Apache 2.0 license
  * please do not hesitate to give us your feedback: **office at itwizard.ro**
(feedback may include, but it is not limited to: observations and questions about code, wish-list of new technical tutorials, contributions to the project, collaboration opportunities etc.)
